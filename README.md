# OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation

We are developing **reinforcement learning (RL)** and **imitation learning (IL)** applications using the **OpenArm** model in the **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab** environment. Our goal is to enable simple simulation, robust learning, and seamless **Sim2Real transfer** for robotic manipulation tasks.

We'll release all code as open source. See the [documentation](https://docs.openarm.dev/simulation/isaac-lab) for now.
