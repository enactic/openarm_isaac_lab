# OpenArm Isaac Lab

Welcome to the **OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation Documentation**.

We are developing **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Imitation Learning (IL)** applications using the **OpenArm** model within the **Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab** environment.
Our aim is to provide:

* Example codes for reinforcement learning tasks with OpenArm
* Seamless **Sim2Real transfer** for robotic manipulation tasks

All code will be released as **open source** to support the research and robotics community.
